# Golden Master - Unified Dependencies
# Universal Stochastic Predictor
# Version: v1.0.0-Diamond-Spec
# Date: February 21, 2026
# Updated: February 21, 2026 - Modular requirements structure

# This file aggregates all project dependencies from modular requirements files
# Organized by layer following Clean Architecture principles

# ==================== Production Dependencies ==================== #
# Core runtime dependencies for Python/ layer
-r Python/requirements.txt

# ==================== Testing & Quality Assurance ==================== #
# Testing infrastructure, code quality, and coverage tools for Test/ layer
# Note: This includes all Python/ dependencies via -r directive
-r Test/requirements.txt

# ==================== Documentation ==================== #
# Documentation tooling for Doc/ layer (currently empty - LaTeX uses system tools)
-r Doc/requirements.txt

# ==================== ARCHITECTURE NOTES ==================== #
# - Python/requirements.txt: 13 packages (JAX, Equinox, Diffrax, OTT, Signax, PyWavelets, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Pydantic, Tomli, Optax, JaxTyping)
# - Test/requirements.txt: +8 packages (pytest, pytest-cov, black, flake8, mypy, isort, matplotlib, seaborn)
# - Doc/requirements.txt: 0 packages (LaTeX compilation uses system tools)
#
# Total unique packages: 21 (13 production + 8 testing)
#
# To install production only: pip install -r Python/requirements.txt
# To install with testing:   pip install -r Test/requirements.txt
# To install everything:     pip install -r requirements.txt (this file)
#
# See Doc/latex/specification/Stochastic_Predictor_Python.tex § for dependency justifications
# See doc/latex/tests/Testing_Infrastructure_Implementation.tex for test pipeline details
