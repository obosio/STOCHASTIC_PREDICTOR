"""Tests - External Validation Layer (Reserved for v3.x.x)

This directory is a placeholder for the comprehensive test suite.

Test implementation is reserved for v3.x.x and will include:
  - Unit tests for each kernel (A, B, C, D)
  - Integration tests for orchestration pipeline
  - Regression tests for numerical stability
  - Hardware-parity tests (CPU vs GPU determinism)
  - End-to-end prediction accuracy benchmarks

See: doc/latex/specification/Stochastic_Predictor_Tests_Python.tex for test specification

Current Implementation Status:
  - v2.0.0: Bootstrap (5-layer architecture scaffold)
  - v2.0.1: API Layer (types, PRNG, validation, schemas, config)
  - v2.0.2: Kernels Layer (A, B, C, D prediction kernels)
  - v3.x.x: Test Suite (PENDING)
